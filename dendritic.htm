											<h2>Visualizing the Brain</h2>
										So, just what is dendritic computation?
			
										When picturing the brain, it is common to think of it as a series of nodes, connected by tendrils. These nodes are the brain cells (neurons) 
										and the tendrils are the dendrites that reach throughout the brain. This is what gives the brain its web-like structure: 
										each brain cell (of which there are roughly eighty-six billion) has approximately 7,000 connections (called synapses) to other neurons. 
										The brain of a three-year-old child is estimated to have about a quadrillion synapses, though this number decreases as they get older.
										</p>
										<p>
										<h2>Why We Need Dendritic Computation</h2>
										Neurons within the brain lie dormant until they receive signals from other cells in the network that stimulates them to fire. This “firing” comes 
										in the form of an electrical impulse called an “action potential” and it tends to correlate with something happening in the brain.
										Stimulate a neuron in the motor cortex and you might twitch a muscle. Alternatively, choose a neuron in the visual cortex and you might see a spot of light. 
										Stimulate one in the hippocampus and you might recall a certain memory.
										</p>
										<p>
							<h2>What is Dendritic Computation?</h2>
										Essentially, dendritic computation refers to the ability of the dendrites themselves to make basic computations. The dendrites, which are the tendrils that 
										receive signals from neighboring neurons, can actually perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They can even handle basic logical operations 
									such as AND, OR, and XOR. These are similar to the building blocks used in electronic circuits and computer programming.
										
										</p>
										<p>
						<h2>The Role of Dendritic Computation</h2>
										This allows for features such as coincident detection: i.e. did two signals come in at the same time.
											How might this be useful for our day-to-day lives? It could, for example, be used to detect whether input arrived from two ears simultaneously. The action 
										potential would only occur in cases where that were true operation. This way, dendrites can consider signals in the context of other signals and they can amplify or reduce the strength of 
										an overall input. We see that voltage signals alter as they travel along dendrites. The “OR” operation means that a neuron fires if it receives one of two specific inputs but not the other 
										(in the simplest of terms). The 1969 book Perceptrons claimed this was impossible to achieve with a single neuron and some feel this misconception may actually have significantly stunted the progress of AI!
