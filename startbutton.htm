Where to start in the progressions: which variation of a given exercise should you start with? Test yourself by trying the different steps in each of the progressions. Once you find a variation of which you can just about perform 4 repetitions with good form, go back one step in the progression, and start your program with 3 sets of 4 repetitions of that variation.
For the planks, find a variation which you can just about perform for 30s with good form, and go back one step in the progression. Start with 30s of that variation.</br>

How to progress: assuming, for example, that you currently can just about manage 4 pull ups with good form. Go back one step in the pull up progression. Your program will start with 3 sets of 4 half pull ups (4,4,4). In your next session, after a day’s rest, you should aim to improve on that number, and perform one more repetition of the exercise (5,4,4). The next session would then call for 5,5,4. Once you can manage 3 sets of 8 repetitions for a given variation (8,8,8), move on to the next step in the progression and start again at 4,4,4. It is crucial that you do not attempt to progress faster than this, but rather stick to micro-increments of one extra repetition with each session. This not only allows for a smooth, constant progression, but it also gives the connective tissue in your joints time to adapt to the stresses placed upon it, and reduces the risk of injury. With planks, try to increase by between 5 and 10s between sessions. Once you can hold a variation for 1 min, move on to the next step.</br>
Systematically aiming to add one repetition to the exercise you last performed is the key to constant improvement. Failing that, your routine will remain stale, and you will not see any strength gains.</br>

Alternating between push ups and dips: it is recommended that you alternate between push ups and dips in each session. Thus, if you have done push ups on a Monday, do dips on a Wednesday (after one day’s rest). However, if you struggle to find a place to do dips from (see suggestions in the dip progression), you could skip dips all together and perform push ups exclusively.</br>

Form: each exercise should be performed through the full range of motion, with good form. This cannot be emphasized enough... As you progress through the program, and as you start reaching your limits, you will be constantly tempted to cheat on your form (often this happens unconsciously), be it by not going through the full range of motion, or by decreasing the leverage of the exercise through subtle body positioning. Besides increasing the risk of injury, not performing each exercise with strict form will limit your progress in the long term and cause you to ‘plateau’.</br>

Cadence: Unless otherwise indicated, when performing any exercise in the progressions, I recommend a cadence of 1 to 2 seconds on the concentric phase, a one second pause at the top of the exercise, and a 3 seconds cadence on the eccentric phase. Thus, when performing a pull up, take 1 to 2 seconds to bring your chin to the bar, pause for 1 second then take 3 seconds on the way down.</br>

Rest periods between sets: strictly speaking, rest periods of between one and 2 minutes are in the realm of strength-endurance, rather than strength alone (see an explanation of rest periods on this page). However, sticking to these slightly shorter rest periods allows you to limit the length of your workout to around one hour, and they remain quite suitable for strength gains. Do not be tempted to increase your rest periods beyond 2 minutes, at least initially, as this will also limit your progress by giving you more time to recover, thus impairing consistency between sessions.</br>

What if the next variation in a progression feels too easy: be grateful! Each variation in the progressions places a slightly different emphasis on different muscle groups, and you might sometimes feel that an exercise which should be harder than the previous one is actually easier for you. In which case, start with 3 sets of 6 repetitions for this exercise, rather than 3 sets of 4. Do not be tempted to skip the variation all together however, as it is often the basis for the variations that follow.</br>

What if the next variation in a progression feels too hard: if you perform the variations of each exercise with good form, the transition from one variation to the next will usually be seamless. Occasionally though –and for a variety of reasons- moving from one variation to the next might prove difficult. In that case, increase the number of repetitions for your current variation up to 3 sets of 12 repetitions. If this still fails to get you to 3 sets of 4 reps for the next variation, 3 sets of 3 reps is an acceptable point from which to build on.</br>

What to do when you reach a plateau: eventually, you will reach a plateau and stop improving. This might be a single occurrence (everyone has a bad day from time to time). Ignore it for the first one or 2 sessions and resume at the point you left at before you stopped progressing (or even started regressing, in the case of a very bad day!). If you do not show progress more than twice in a row, it is time to deload and start rebuilding from there. Take an extra rest day, and start again at a lower point in the progression. For instance, if you get stuck at 8,7,7 repetitions for a given variation, start again with 6,6,6 after an extra rest day, and proceed from there. Failing that, modifying the basic routine to be better suited to your goals will often kick start your progress again.</br>

Left-right imbalances: the Start Bodyweight basic routine contains a number of unilateral exercises such as one leg squats, one arm push ups, etc. Often, these can highlight imbalances inherent in the body, which are in fact quite easy to correct. Always start with your weakest side/arm/leg and never exceed the number of reps you have just performed when you switch to the other side. This will quickly correct any pre-existing imbalances, and prevent you from making them worse.</br>

 Adding deadlifts to the basic routine: though the routine does target your lower back muscles through eccentric contractions during the lowering phase of leg raises, and through the planks, it is recommended that you add deadlifts if you have access to a barbell and plates, or dumbbells. Perform 3 sets of 4-8 reps at the beginning of every session, having sought proper instruction in the exercise.</br> 

When can I start introducing gymnastic rings?: Gymnastic rings are a great tool, and incredibly versatile. They can be used for pull ups, dips, muscle ups, levers, hamstring curls, push ups… and the list goes on. And, if I could only have one piece of equipment at home, they would probably be my first choice. BUT, in the context of a beginner to intermediate workout, they are not an ideal introduction to bodyweight training: they add an element of instability which makes the transition from other exercises very difficult, particularly dips, as exercises on rings have a much higher motor unit recruitment. Their instability also means added stress is placed on joints and their connective tissue. Finally, because rings can rotate, they allow you to load the shoulder joint in a much greater range of motion than other exercises. This is great when movements are well controlled, but it can lead to injuries until you’ve developed the necessary strength to enable that degree of control.</br>
I wouldn't recommend using them until you can do at least 3 sets of 12 parallel bar dips comfortably. And in the context of the Start Bodyweight basic routine and progressions, not until you reach modified russian dips. Even then, they should be introduced gradually...
